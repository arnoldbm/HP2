## üéâ Milestone 4 Highlights

**What Changed**: This milestone introduced global team state management, making it easy for any page to access the currently selected team.

**Key Benefits**:
1. **Seamless Navigation**: Team selection persists across page refreshes
2. **Clean Architecture**: Context API provides clean separation of concerns
3. **User-Friendly**: Dropdown selector makes switching teams intuitive
4. **Mobile-Optimized**: Touch-friendly UI with proper sizing (56px targets)
5. **Well-Tested**: 32 comprehensive tests ensure reliability

**Developer Experience**:
```typescript
// Easy access to team context from any component
const { selectedTeamId, currentTeam, selectTeam, isLoading } = useTeam()

// Change teams programmatically
selectTeam('new-team-id')

// Check if team is loaded
if (currentTeam) {
  console.log(`Current team: ${currentTeam.name}`)
}
```

**Ready for Milestone 5**: With team selection working, we can now integrate roster data into game tracking and analytics! üöÄ
