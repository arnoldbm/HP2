## [Phase 3 Complete + Authentication] - 2025-10-28

### 🎉 Major Milestone: Full Authentication System + Phase 3 Complete!

This release adds a production-ready authentication system with email confirmation and password reset, completing Phase 3 with both analytics and auth working together.

### Added

#### Authentication System
- **Auth Components**
  - `components/auth/auth-form.tsx` - Reusable authentication form with sign up/sign in modes
    - Email/password authentication
    - Full name field for user registration
    - Password reset functionality
    - Resend confirmation email
    - Improved error messages with specific handling for common auth errors
    - Local development email link (localhost:54324)
  - `components/auth/auth-modal.tsx` - Modal wrapper with mode toggling
  - `app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx` - Password reset page with email verification
    - Session validation from reset link
    - Password confirmation with validation
    - Auto-redirect to demo page after success

- **Authentication Features**
  - Email confirmation required before sign-in
  - Password reset flow with email verification
  - Session management with `onAuthStateChange` listeners
  - Auto-redirect on 403/RLS policy violations
  - Auto-signout when RLS policies deny access
  - User-specific data isolation via team memberships

- **Demo Setup for Authenticated Users**
  - Updated `app/actions/demo-setup.ts` to accept userId parameter
  - Each user gets their own organization (unique slug: `demo-org-{userId}`)
  - Auto-creates team membership linking user to team
  - Server-side user verification

- **Updated Demo Pages**
  - `app/demo/game-tracking/page.tsx` now requires authentication
  - Auth state checking on mount
  - Sign out button with proper session cleanup
  - Auth modal shown when not authenticated
  - Loading states for auth checks

#### Database & Security
- **Fixed RLS Policies** (`supabase/migrations/20251028_fix_team_members_rls.sql`)
  - Added SELECT policies to `team_members` table (was blocking RLS subqueries)
  - Policy: "Users can view all team memberships" (needed for game_events RLS to work)
  - Policy: "Users can view their own memberships"
  - Policy: "Team members can add other members"

- **Demo Game Support** (`supabase/migrations/20251028104517_add_demo_game_support.sql`)
  - Database migrations for demo game setup

- **Enhanced Error Handling** (`lib/db/game-events.ts`)
  - All database operations now detect RLS errors (code 42501)
  - Auto-signout on RLS policy violations
  - Clear error logging for debugging

#### Configuration
- **Updated Supabase Config** (`supabase/config.toml`)
  - Added `additional_redirect_urls` for password reset redirects
  - URLs: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/auth/reset-password`, `http://localhost:3000/auth/reset-password`
  - Enables proper password reset flow

### Changed

#### Authentication Flow
- All database operations now include authentication checks
- Session validation before API calls
- Improved error messages guiding users to create accounts after database resets
- Better handling of expired or invalid sessions

### Fixed

- **RLS Policy Issue**: `team_members` table had RLS enabled but no SELECT policies, causing `game_events` INSERT policy subqueries to fail
- **Password Reset Redirects**: Emails now properly redirect to `/auth/reset-password` page
- **Session Persistence**: Auth state properly synced across page loads and refreshes

### Documentation Updates
- Updated `README.md`:
  - Added "Local Development Tools" section
  - Documented Supabase Studio (localhost:54323)
  - Documented Mailpit email inbox (localhost:54324)

- Updated `CLAUDE.md`:
  - Added authentication components section
  - Added 2 new migrations to database section
  - Updated dates to 2025-10-28
  - Updated Phase 3 to include authentication
  - Updated project status to ~60% complete
  - Added local development tools URLs
  - Updated quick start section for new sessions

## [Phase 3 Complete - Analytics] - 2025-10-27

### 🎉 Major Milestone: Post-Game Analytics Dashboard Complete!

This marks the completion of Phase 3, delivering a fully functional analytics dashboard that visualizes game tracking data with multiple chart types and intelligent insights.

### Added

#### Analytics Calculation Functions (`lib/analytics/game-analytics.ts`)

  - Shot location visualization overlaid on ice surface
  - Color-coded by result (goal=green, save=blue, miss=red/amber, blocked=gray, post=purple)
  - Size indicates shot quality (high=12px, medium=8px, low=6px)
  - Interactive tooltips showing shot details
  - Legend and stats overlay

- **Shot Quality Chart** (`components/analytics/shot-quality-chart.tsx`)
  - Bar chart showing shot distribution by danger level
  - Summary cards for total shots, goals, shooting %, high danger %
  - Detailed table with conversion rates by quality
  - Recharts integration for responsive visualizations

- **Breakout Analysis** (`components/analytics/breakout-analysis.tsx`)
  - Pie chart showing success/fail breakdown
  - Bar chart by breakout type with success rates
  - Auto-generated insights (most used type, most effective type)
  - Detailed table with all breakout types

- **Period Trends** (`components/analytics/period-trends.tsx`)
  - Bar chart for shots and goals by period
  - Line chart showing event activity trends over periods
  - Period-by-period comparison table
  - Auto-generated insights (most offensive pressure, turnover trends)

#### Analytics Dashboard (`app/demo/analytics/page.tsx`)
- Complete analytics dashboard integrating all visualization components
- Filters by period (1, 2, 3, all)
- Filters by situation (even strength, power play, penalty kill, all)
- Real-time event counting
- Situation stats quick view
- Navigation from game tracking page
- Empty state with helpful messaging

### Changed

#### Data Model Simplification
- **Removed 'goal' as separate event type** - Goals are now shots with `result='goal'`
  - Migration: `supabase/migrations/20251027235333_remove_goal_event_type.sql`
  - Updated existing 'goal' events to 'shot' with result='goal'
  - Modified database enum to remove 'goal'
  - Updated shot quality trigger to only check 'shot' events
  - Preserved UX: Goal button pre-fills result field in UI

- Updated `lib/stores/game-tracking-store.ts`:
  - Removed 'goal' from EventType enum
  - Added `prefilledDetails` parameter to `startEventLogging()`
  - Simplified `getShotStats()` to only filter 'shot' events

- Updated `components/game-tracking/quick-event-buttons.tsx`:
  - Goal button creates 'shot' with `prefilledDetails: { result: 'goal' }`
  - Added `prefilledDetails` parameter to interface

- Updated `components/game-tracking/event-logger.tsx`:

- Fixed 8 tests in `tests/unit/quick-event-buttons.test.tsx`
- Fixed test in `tests/integration/game-event-persistence.test.ts`
- Fixed 2 tests in `tests/integration/game-events.test.ts`
- All tests now expect second parameter (prefilledDetails) in event selection

#### UI Enhancements

- Updated demo page descriptions and feature lists
- Improved navigation between tracking and analytics

### Documentation Updates
- Updated `CLAUDE.md`:

### Technical Decisions
1. **Goal Event Simplification**: Treating goals as shots with result='goal' eliminates data model redundancy
2. **Recharts Library**: Using pre-installed Recharts for all analytics visualizations (bar, line, pie charts)
3. **Client-Side Analytics**: Computing analytics in real-time from event data (no pre-computation needed for MVP)
4. **Optimistic Updates**: Maintained for analytics - events appear instantly, sync in background
