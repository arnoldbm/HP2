## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow

```typescript
User loads page
  â†“
Check authentication
  â†“
Fetch user's team
  â†“
Load all practices for team
  â†“
Apply filters (status, type)
  â†“
Display filtered practices
  â†“
User clicks "View Details"
  â†“
Load practice drills & source game
  â†“
Show modal with full details
```

### Database Queries

**1. Load Practices**
```sql
SELECT * FROM practices
WHERE team_id = ?
ORDER BY practice_date DESC
```

**2. Load Practice Drills** (when viewing details)
```sql
SELECT
  pd.*,
  d.title,
  d.description,
  d.category
FROM practice_drills pd
JOIN drills d ON pd.drill_id = d.id
WHERE pd.practice_id = ?
ORDER BY pd.section, pd.sequence_order
```

**3. Load Source Game** (for AI-generated plans)
```sql
SELECT opponent_name, game_date
FROM games
WHERE id = ?
```

### State Management

```typescript
// Core state
const [practices, setPractices] = useState<Practice[]>([])
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null)

// Filtering state
const [statusFilter, setStatusFilter] = useState<string>('all')
const [aiFilter, setAiFilter] = useState<string>('all')

// Modal state
const [selectedPractice, setSelectedPractice] = useState<Practice | null>(null)
const [drills, setDrills] = useState<PracticeDrillWithDetails[]>([])
const [sourceGame, setSourceGame] = useState<SourceGame | null>(null)
const [loadingDetails, setLoadingDetails] = useState(false)
```

### Filtering Logic

**Combined Filter Function:**
```typescript
const filteredPractices = practices.filter((practice) => {
  // Status filter
  if (statusFilter !== 'all' && practice.status !== statusFilter) {
    return false
  }

  // AI/Manual filter
  if (aiFilter === 'ai' && !practice.generated_by_ai) {
    return false
  }
  if (aiFilter === 'manual' && practice.generated_by_ai) {
    return false
  }

  return true
})
```

### TypeScript Types

```typescript
interface Practice {
  id: string
  team_id: string
  practice_date: string
  duration_minutes: number
  location: string | null
  notes: string | null
  objectives: string | null
  generated_by_ai: boolean
  based_on_game_id: string | null
  ai_reasoning: {
    overall_assessment?: string
    top_focus_areas?: string[]
    practice_goals?: string[]
  } | null
  status: 'planned' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'cancelled'
  completed_at: string | null
  created_at: string
}

interface PracticeDrillWithDetails {
  id: string
  practice_id: string
  drill_id: string
  section: 'warm_up' | 'main' | 'cool_down'
  sequence_order: number
  duration_minutes: number
  notes: string | null
  modifications: string | null
  completed: boolean
  drills: {
    id: string
    title: string
    description: string
    category: string
  }
}

interface SourceGame {
  opponent_name: string
  game_date: string
}
```

## UI/UX Design

### Color Coding

**Status Badges:**
- Planned: Gray
- In Progress: Blue
- Completed: Green
- Cancelled: Red

**Type Badges:**
- AI Generated: Purple with ðŸ¤– emoji
- Manual: Gray

**Stats Cards:**

- Type filter: `aria-label="Filter by type"`
- All interactive elements have proper labels

**Semantic HTML:**
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
- Table structure for practice list
- Form elements properly labeled with `htmlFor`

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- Modal can be closed with X button
- All buttons are keyboard accessible
- Proper focus management

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run practice history tests only
npm test tests/unit/practice-history.test.tsx

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

### Test Mocking Strategy

**Supabase Client Mock:**
```typescript
vi.mock('@/lib/db/supabase', () => ({
  supabase: {
    auth: {
      getUser: vi.fn(),
    },
    from: vi.fn(),
  },
}))
```

**Next.js Link Mock:**
```typescript
vi.mock('next/link', () => ({
  default: ({ children, href }: { children: React.ReactNode; href: string }) => (
    <a href={href}>{children}</a>
  ),
}))
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Practices not loading

**Solution:**
1. Check authentication status
2. Verify user has team membership
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure Supabase is running: `npx supabase status`

### Issue: "Auth error" after database reset

**Solution:**
The page now automatically detects and clears invalid sessions. Simply refresh the page and sign in again.

### Issue: Modal not showing drill details

**Solution:**
1. Check that practice_drills exist for the practice
2. Verify drill library is populated
3. Check console for query errors

### Issue: Filters not working

**Solution:**
1. Verify state is updating (check React DevTools)
2. Ensure filter logic matches database values
3. Check that filtered array is being used for display

## Navigation Flow

**Entry Points:**
1. From Analytics page â†’ "View Practice History" button
2. From main demo page â†’ "ðŸ“‹ Practice History" card
3. Direct URL: `/demo/practice-history`

**Exit Points:**
1. "Back to Analytics" link â†’ Returns to analytics page
2. Creating new practice â†’ Redirects from practice builder

## Future Enhancements

**Potential Improvements:**
- [ ] Export practice plan to PDF
- [ ] Print-friendly view
- [ ] Edit practice plan
- [ ] Duplicate practice plan
- [ ] Archive old practices
- [ ] Search within practice plans
- [ ] Sort by different fields (date, duration, status)
- [ ] Bulk actions (delete multiple, mark multiple as completed)
- [ ] Calendar view of practices
- [ ] Practice plan templates

## Performance Considerations

**Optimization Strategies:**
1. Practices loaded once on mount
2. Filtering happens client-side (fast)
3. Modal details loaded on-demand (lazy loading)
4. No unnecessary re-renders
5. Efficient database queries with proper indexes

**Scalability:**
- Current implementation handles 100+ practices smoothly
- For larger datasets, consider:
  - Pagination
  - Virtual scrolling
  - Server-side filtering
  - Caching strategies
