## Troubleshooting

### "Add to Home Screen" option missing (iOS)
- **Make sure you're using Safari** (not Chrome or Firefox)
- **Check iOS version**: iOS 11.3+ required
- **Try closing/reopening Safari** and visiting the page again

- **Check for banner**: Look for install banner at bottom of screen
- **Use menu**: Three dots ‚Üí "Add to Home Screen"

### Fullscreen button not showing (iOS in browser)

- **Alternative**: Scroll down to hide address bar

### Fullscreen button not showing (Android)
- **Check browser**: Must be Chrome, Edge, or other Chromium browser
