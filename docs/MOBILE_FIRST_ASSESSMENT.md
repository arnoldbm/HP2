### 2. Practice Builder - Drag & Drop Interface
**Current Issues:**
- ❌ Desktop-only drag-and-drop (doesn't work on touch)
- ❌ Sidebar layout doesn't work on mobile
- ❌ Drill cards too small for touch selection
- ❌ No alternative to drag-and-drop for mobile

**Impact:** Coaches want to build practice plans on mobile

**Mobile-First Solution:**
```

```

**Specific Changes Needed:**
- [ ] Replace table with card-based layout
- [ ] Each practice = card with key info + "View" button
- [ ] Stats cards: 2x2 grid on mobile instead of 1x4
- [ ] Filters stack vertically
- [ ] Practice detail modal becomes full-screen on mobile
- [ ] Modal sections use accordions (collapsed by default)
- [ ] Drill cards within sections are compact

**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH (Week 2)

---

### 4. Analytics Dashboard - Charts & Visualizations
**Current Issues:**
- ❌ Fixed-width charts overflow on mobile
- ❌ Shot chart (800x400) doesn't scale
- ❌ Multi-column layouts stack awkwardly
- ❌ AI practice plan display too wide

**Mobile-First Solution:**
- [ ] All charts responsive (use 100% width, maintain aspect)
- [ ] Shot chart: Portrait orientation on mobile (400x600)
- [ ] Filters stack vertically with full-width inputs
- [ ] Stats cards: 1 column on mobile, 3 columns on desktop
- [ ] AI practice plan: Full-screen scrollable view
- [ ] Collapsible sections to reduce initial scroll height

**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH (Week 2-3)

---

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES (Polish)

### 5. Drill Library Page
**Current Issues:**
- ✅ Already mostly responsive
- 🟡 Drill cards could be optimized for mobile

**Improvements:**
- [ ] Full-width search bar on mobile
- [ ] Larger drill cards (easier to tap)
- [ ] Category filter as bottom sheet instead of dropdown
- [ ] "Load more" button instead of showing all 27+ drills

**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐ MEDIUM (Week 3)

---

### 6. Home/Landing Page
**Current Status:** Already quite good!
- ✅ Grid already responsive (1 col → 2 cols)
- ✅ Cards are touch-friendly

**Minor Improvements:**
- [ ] Slightly larger text on mobile
- [ ] Add icons to feature cards
- [ ] Optimize for one-handed use (bottom nav?)

**Priority:** ⭐⭐ LOW (Week 4)

---

## 📱 Mobile-First Design Principles

### 1. Touch Targets
- **Minimum:** 44x44px (iOS), 48x48px (Android)
- **Ideal:** 56x56px for primary actions
- **Spacing:** 8px minimum between touch targets

### 2. Typography
```css
/* Mobile-first text sizes */
h1: text-2xl (24px)  /* Not 4xl on mobile */
h2: text-xl (20px)
h3: text-lg (18px)
body: text-base (16px)
small: text-sm (14px)
```

### 3. Layout Patterns
- **Stack first:** Default to single column
- **Progressive enhancement:** Add columns at breakpoints
- **Bottom sheets:** Better than dropdowns for multi-select
- **Accordions:** Reduce scroll, show-on-demand content
- **Fixed position:** Use sparingly (bottom nav, action buttons)

### 4. Touch Gestures
- **Swipe:** Navigate, dismiss, reveal actions
- **Long-press:** Context menu, reorder mode
- **Pull-to-refresh:** Reload data
- **Pinch-to-zoom:** Charts, ice surface (optional)

### 5. Performance
- **Viewport units:** Use vw/vh for full-screen experiences
- **CSS animations:** Better than JS on mobile
- **Lazy load:** Images, charts, drill lists
- **Reduce network:** Cache data locally

## 📏 Breakpoint Strategy

```css
/* Mobile First - Start with smallest screen */
/* Default styles = Mobile (< 640px) */

/* Tailwind Breakpoints: */
sm: 640px   /* Large phones, small tablets */
md: 768px   /* Tablets */
lg: 1024px  /* Laptops */
xl: 1280px  /* Desktops */
2xl: 1536px /* Large desktops */
```

**Our Strategy:**
- Write base styles for **mobile** (320px - 639px)
- Add `sm:` for phablets and large phones
- Add `md:` for tablets (portrait)
- Add `lg:` for tablets (landscape) and laptops
- Add `xl:` for large desktops (optional polish)

**Example:**
```tsx
// Mobile-first button
<button className="
  w-full py-4 text-lg          /* Mobile: full width, large touch target */
  sm:w-auto sm:px-6            /* Large phones: auto width with padding */
  md:py-2 md:text-base         /* Tablets: smaller, more compact */
">
  Save Practice
</button>
```

## 🎨 Mobile Component Library

### Bottom Sheet (for mobile modals)
```tsx
<BottomSheet
  isOpen={showPlayerSelector}
  onClose={() => setShowPlayerSelector(false)}
  snapPoints={[0.9, 0.5]}  // 90% or 50% of screen height
>
  <PlayerSelector onSelect={handlePlayerSelect} />
</BottomSheet>
```

### Accordion Section
```tsx
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Warm-up (2 drills)" defaultOpen={false}>
    <DrillCard drill={drill1} />
    <DrillCard drill={drill2} />
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### Touch-Friendly Card
```tsx
<TouchCard
  onClick={handleClick}
  minHeight="80px"  // Ensures 48px+ touch target with padding
>
  {content}
</TouchCard>
```

### Swipeable List Item
```tsx
<SwipeableItem
  onSwipeLeft={() => handleDelete(id)}
  onSwipeRight={() => handleEdit(id)}
  leftAction={{ icon: '🗑️', color: 'red' }}
  rightAction={{ icon: '✏️', color: 'blue' }}
>
  {itemContent}
</SwipeableItem>
```
