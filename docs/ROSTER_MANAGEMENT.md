## 🎯 Overview

The Player Roster Management feature allows coaches to manage their team rosters with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. This is a foundational feature that enables:

- **Team Building**: Add players to teams with jersey numbers, positions, and birthdates
- **Roster Organization**: View all players in a clean, organized list
- **Player Updates**: Edit player information as needed
- **Jersey Management**: Ensure jersey numbers are unique per team (1-99)
- **Mobile-First UX**: Swipeable cards on mobile, table layout on desktop

### Key Features

✅ **Add Players**: Bottom sheet form with jersey number, name, position, birthdate
✅ **Edit Players**: Same form pre-filled with existing data
✅ **Delete Players**: Swipe-to-delete on mobile, delete button on desktop
✅ **Empty State**: Friendly empty state with CTA when no players exist
✅ **Jersey Uniqueness**: Validation prevents duplicate jersey numbers per team
✅ **Position Types**: Forward, Defense, Goalie selection with button group
✅ **Mobile Optimized**: Bottom sheets, swipeable cards, touch-friendly targets

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Players Table (Existing)

```sql
CREATE TABLE players (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  team_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  jersey_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  position player_position NOT NULL,
  birthdate DATE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),

  -- Constraints
  CONSTRAINT unique_jersey_per_team UNIQUE (team_id, jersey_number),
  CONSTRAINT valid_jersey_range CHECK (jersey_number >= 1 AND jersey_number <= 99)
);

-- Enum for positions
CREATE TYPE player_position AS ENUM ('forward', 'defense', 'goalie');

-- RLS Policies
ALTER TABLE players ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Users can view players on teams they belong to
CREATE POLICY select_team_players ON players
  FOR SELECT USING (
    team_id IN (
      SELECT team_id FROM team_members WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Users can create players on teams they belong to
CREATE POLICY insert_team_players ON players
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    team_id IN (
      SELECT team_id FROM team_members WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Users can update players on teams they belong to
CREATE POLICY update_team_players ON players
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    team_id IN (
      SELECT team_id FROM team_members WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Users can delete players on teams they belong to
CREATE POLICY delete_team_players ON players
  FOR DELETE USING (
    team_id IN (
      SELECT team_id FROM team_members WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

### Key Design Decisions

**1. Jersey Number Uniqueness**
- Constraint: `UNIQUE (team_id, jersey_number)`
- Rationale: Same jersey # can exist on different teams, but not on same team
- Validation: Server-side check before insert to provide friendly error message

**2. Position Enum**
- Values: `forward`, `defense`, `goalie`
- Rationale: Standardized positions, prevents typos, enables filtering
- Storage: Stored as enum (efficient), displayed with helper functions

**3. Cascade Deletion**
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from teams table
- Rationale: When team deleted, players auto-deleted (no orphans)
- Safety: RLS prevents unauthorized team deletion

**4. Birthdate Optional**
- Type: `DATE` (nullable)
- Rationale: Not all coaches track birthdates, especially for older age groups
- Future: Can be used for age verification, eligibility tracking

## ⚙️ Server Actions

### File: `app/actions/players.ts`

All player operations use server actions (not API routes) for better type safety and automatic server-side execution.

#### 1. `createPlayer(input: PlayerCreateInput)`

**Purpose:** Add new player to team roster

**Input Schema:**
```typescript
{
  team_id: string (UUID)
  jersey_number: number (1-99)
  first_name: string (1-50 chars, trimmed)
  last_name: string (1-50 chars, trimmed)
  position: 'forward' | 'defense' | 'goalie'
  birthdate?: string (ISO date, optional)
}
```

**Process:**
1. Validate input with Zod schema
2. Check if jersey number already exists on this team
3. If duplicate, return error: "Jersey number X is already taken on this team"
4. Insert player into database
5. Return success with player object

**RLS Security:** Only inserts if user is member of team (via team_members table)

**Tests:** 7 integration tests
- ✅ Create player with valid data
- ✅ Validate required fields (jersey, names, position)
- ✅ Reject duplicate jersey number on same team
- ✅ Allow same jersey number on different teams
- ✅ Validate jersey range (1-99)
- ✅ Handle optional birthdate
- ✅ RLS prevents unauthorized creation

---

#### 2. `getTeamRoster(teamId: string)`

**Purpose:** Fetch all players for a team

**Process:**
1. Query players table filtered by team_id
2. Order by position (alphabetically: defense, forward, goalie), then jersey_number
3. Return array of players

**RLS Security:** Only returns players if user is member of team

**Tests:** 3 integration tests
- ✅ Fetch all players for team
- ✅ Return empty array if no players
- ✅ RLS prevents viewing other teams' rosters

---

#### 3. `updatePlayer(playerId: string, input: PlayerUpdateInput)`

**Purpose:** Update existing player information

**Input Schema:** (all fields optional)
```typescript
{
  jersey_number?: number (1-99)
  first_name?: string (1-50 chars, trimmed)
  last_name?: string (1-50 chars, trimmed)
  position?: 'forward' | 'defense' | 'goalie'
  birthdate?: string (ISO date)
}
```

**Process:**
1. Validate input with Zod schema
2. If updating jersey_number, check for conflicts on same team
3. Update only provided fields (partial update)
4. Return updated player object

**RLS Security:** Only updates if user is member of team

**Tests:** 4 integration tests
- ✅ Update player details
- ✅ Partial updates (only some fields)
- ✅ Prevent duplicate jersey on update
- ✅ RLS prevents unauthorized updates

---

#### 4. `deletePlayer(playerId: string)`

**Purpose:** Remove player from roster

**Process:**
1. Delete player from database by ID
2. Return success confirmation

**RLS Security:** Only deletes if user is member of team

**Tests:** 3 integration tests
- ✅ Delete player successfully
- ✅ Cascade doesn't affect other teams
- ✅ RLS prevents unauthorized deletion

---

## 🎨 UI Components

### 1. PlayerForm Component

**File:** `components/teams/player-form.tsx`
**Purpose:** Reusable form for adding and editing players
**Framework:** React Hook Form + Zod validation

#### Props Interface

```typescript
interface PlayerFormProps {
  teamId: string                    // Team to add player to
  onSuccess: (data: any) => void   // Callback after successful save
  onCancel?: () => void            // Callback to close form
  initialData?: {                  // Pre-fill for edit mode
    id: string
    jersey_number: number
    first_name: string
    last_name: string
    position: 'forward' | 'defense' | 'goalie'
    birthdate?: string
  }
}
```

#### Form Fields

**1. Jersey Number**
- Type: `number` input
- Validation: Required, 1-99, integer
- Placeholder: "1-99"
- HTML attributes: `min={1} max={99}`

**2. First Name**
- Type: `text` input
- Validation: Required, 1-50 chars, trimmed
- Placeholder: "John"

**3. Last Name**
- Type: `text` input
- Validation: Required, 1-50 chars, trimmed
- Placeholder: "Doe"

**4. Position**
- Type: Button group (3 buttons)
- Options: Forward, Defense, Goalie
- Validation: Required
- Visual: Selected button has blue background, white text
- Implementation: Hidden input + `setValue()` on button click

**5. Birthdate**
- Type: `date` input
- Validation: Optional, valid ISO date
- Label: "Birthdate (Optional)"

#### Styling & Spacing

```css
/* Form container */
space-y-5  /* 20px between fields */
px-6       /* 24px horizontal padding */
pb-8       /* 32px bottom padding */

/* Labels */
mb-2       /* 8px between label and input */

/* Submit button section */
pt-4       /* 16px top padding */
```

#### States & Behavior

**Add Mode:** (no `initialData`)
- Submit button: "Add Player"
- Form starts empty
- On success: Calls `onSuccess()` with player data

**Edit Mode:** (has `initialData`)
- Submit button: "Update Player"
- Form pre-filled with existing data
- On success: Calls `onSuccess()` with updated data

**Loading State:**
- Submit button disabled during submission
- Text changes: "Adding..." or "Updating..."

**Error Handling:**
- Inline validation errors below each field
- Red text with error messages from Zod schema
- Position error: "Please select a position"

#### Integration with BottomSheet

```tsx
<BottomSheet isOpen={showAddForm} onClose={() => setShowAddForm(false)} title="Add Player">
  <PlayerForm
    teamId={teamId}
    onSuccess={handleAddPlayer}
    onCancel={() => setShowAddForm(false)}
  />
</BottomSheet>
```

---

### 2. RosterList Component

**File:** `components/teams/roster-list.tsx`
**Purpose:** Display roster with mobile/desktop layouts

#### Props Interface

```typescript
interface RosterListProps {
  players: Player[]
  onEdit: (player: Player) => void
  onDelete: (playerId: string) => void
}
```

#### Empty State

When `players.length === 0`:

```tsx
<div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow p-12 text-center">
  {/* People icon SVG */}
  <h3>No players yet</h3>
  <p>Add your first player to get started</p>
</div>
```

#### Mobile Layout (`md:hidden`)

**Design Pattern:** Swipeable cards

```tsx
<SwipeableItem onDelete={() => handleDelete(player.id)}>
  <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow p-4 flex items-center gap-4">
    {/* Jersey badge */}
    <div className="w-12 h-12 rounded-full bg-blue-100">
      <span>#{player.jersey_number}</span>
    </div>

    {/* Player info */}
    <div className="flex-1">
      <h4>{player.first_name} {player.last_name}</h4>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">{formatPosition(player.position)}</p>
    </div>

    {/* Edit button */}
    <button onClick={() => onEdit(player)}>Edit</button>
  </div>
</SwipeableItem>
```

**Interaction:**
- Tap card: No action (could expand in future)
- Swipe left: Reveals delete button
- Tap "Edit": Opens edit form
- Tap delete: Confirms then deletes

#### Desktop Layout (`hidden md:block`)

**Design Pattern:** Data table

| # | Player Name | Position | Actions |
|---|-------------|----------|---------|
| 12 | John Doe | F - Forward | Edit \| Delete |

**Features:**
- Sortable columns (future enhancement)
- Position badge: `F - Forward`, `D - Defense`, `G - Goalie`
- Hover effect on rows
- Inline edit/delete buttons

**Delete Confirmation:**
```javascript
if (confirm('Are you sure you want to remove this player from the roster?')) {
  await onDelete(playerId)
}
```

---

### 3. Roster Page

**File:** `app/demo/teams/[teamId]/roster/page.tsx`
**Route:** `/demo/teams/[teamId]/roster`

#### Page Structure

```tsx
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-50 py-8">
  <div className="max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 pb-24">
    {/* Header */}
    <div className="mb-8">
      <button>← Back to Teams</button>
      <h1>Thunder 2015 Roster</h1>
      <p>10U • AA • 2025-26</p>
    </div>

    {/* Error Alert */}
    {error && <div className="bg-red-50">...</div>}

    {/* Add Player Button */}
    <div className="mb-8">
      <button onClick={() => setShowAddForm(true)}>+ Add Player</button>
    </div>

    {/* Roster List */}
    <RosterList players={players} onEdit={...} onDelete={...} />

    {/* Add Player Modal */}
    <BottomSheet isOpen={showAddForm}>
      <PlayerForm teamId={teamId} onSuccess={handleAddPlayer} />
    </BottomSheet>

    {/* Edit Player Modal */}
    <BottomSheet isOpen={!!editingPlayer}>
      <PlayerForm initialData={editingPlayer} onSuccess={handleUpdatePlayer} />
    </BottomSheet>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### State Management

```typescript
const [players, setPlayers] = useState<Player[]>([])
const [team, setTeam] = useState<any>(null)
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true)
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null)
const [showAddForm, setShowAddForm] = useState(false)
const [editingPlayer, setEditingPlayer] = useState<Player | null>(null)
```

#### Data Loading

```typescript
async function loadTeamAndRoster() {
  // 1. Get authenticated user
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()

  // 2. Fetch team details
  const { data: teamData } = await supabase
    .from('teams_with_age_display')
    .select()
    .eq('id', params.teamId)
    .single()

  // 3. Fetch roster
  const result = await getTeamRoster(params.teamId)
  setPlayers(result.players)
}
```

#### CRUD Handlers

**Add Player:**
```typescript
const handleAddPlayer = async (data: PlayerCreateInput) => {
  const result = await createPlayer(data)
  if (result.success) {
    setPlayers([...players, result.player])  // Optimistic update
    setShowAddForm(false)
  } else {
    setError(result.error)
  }
}
```

**Update Player:**
```typescript
const handleUpdatePlayer = async (data: PlayerCreateInput) => {
  const result = await updatePlayer(editingPlayer.id, data)
  if (result.success) {
    setPlayers(players.map(p =>
      p.id === editingPlayer.id ? result.player : p
    ))
    setEditingPlayer(null)
  }
}
```

**Delete Player:**
```typescript
const handleDeletePlayer = async (playerId: string) => {
  const result = await deletePlayer(playerId)
  if (result.success) {
    setPlayers(players.filter(p => p.id !== playerId))
  }
}
```

---

## ✅ Validation & Business Rules

### Client-Side Validation (Zod Schema)

**File:** `lib/validation/player-schemas.ts`

```typescript
export const playerCreateSchema = z.object({
  team_id: z.string().uuid('Invalid team ID'),

  jersey_number: z
    .number({
      required_error: 'Jersey number is required',
      invalid_type_error: 'Jersey number is required'
    })
    .int('Jersey number must be an integer')
    .min(1, 'Jersey number must be at least 1')
    .max(99, 'Jersey number must be at most 99'),

  first_name: z
    .string({ required_error: 'First name is required' })
    .min(1, 'First name is required')
    .max(50, 'First name must be at most 50 characters')
    .trim(),

  last_name: z
    .string({ required_error: 'Last name is required' })
    .min(1, 'Last name is required')
    .max(50, 'Last name must be at most 50 characters')
    .trim(),

  position: playerPositionEnum,

  birthdate: z.string().date().optional(),
})
```

### Server-Side Validation

**1. Jersey Uniqueness Check:**
```typescript
const { data: existingPlayer } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('players')
  .select('id')
  .eq('team_id', validatedData.team_id)
  .eq('jersey_number', validatedData.jersey_number)
  .single()

if (existingPlayer) {
  return {
    success: false,
    error: `Jersey number ${validatedData.jersey_number} is already taken on this team`
  }
}
```

**2. Database Constraints:**
- `UNIQUE (team_id, jersey_number)` - Prevents duplicates at DB level
- `CHECK (jersey_number >= 1 AND jersey_number <= 99)` - Enforces range
- `NOT NULL` on required fields - Prevents missing data

### Business Rules

**Rule 1: Jersey Numbers**
- Range: 1-99 (standard hockey)
- Uniqueness: Per team only (same # allowed on different teams)
- Why: Mirrors real-world hockey jersey numbering

**Rule 2: Positions**
- Enum: Forward, Defense, Goalie
- Required: Every player must have position
- Why: Essential for lineup planning, statistics

**Rule 3: Names**
- Max length: 50 characters each
- Trimmed: Auto-remove leading/trailing spaces
- Required: Both first and last name
- Why: Prevent display issues, ensure completeness

**Rule 4: Birthdate**
- Optional: Not all coaches track this
- Format: ISO date string (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Future use: Age verification, eligibility tracking

## 📱 Mobile-First Design

### Design Philosophy

**Progressive Enhancement Approach:**
1. Design for mobile FIRST (320px-768px)
2. Add desktop features SECOND (769px+)
3. Use `md:` breakpoint for responsive switches

### Mobile Optimizations

**1. Bottom Sheet Modals**
- Pattern: Slides up from bottom (native iOS/Android feel)
- Dismissal: Swipe down or tap X button
- Scrollable: Content scrolls inside sheet
- Padding: `pb-6` ensures submit buttons visible

**2. Swipeable Cards**
- Component: `<SwipeableItem>`
- Gesture: Swipe left to reveal delete
- Threshold: 80px swipe distance
- Visual: Red delete button slides in

**3. Touch Targets**
- Minimum: 44px (iOS guideline)
- Buttons: 56px+ (comfortable for thumbs)
- Edit button: Full height of card (easy tap)

**4. Spacing**
- Between cards: `space-y-2` (8px)
- Card padding: `p-4` (16px)
- Form fields: `space-y-5` (20px)

### Desktop Enhancements

**1. Table Layout**
- Sortable columns (future)
- More data density
- Hover states on rows
- Inline actions (no modals needed)

**2. Modal Instead of Sheet**
- Center-screen modal (not bottom sheet)
- Backdrop overlay
- Wider form (more horizontal space)

**3. Keyboard Shortcuts** (future)
- `Cmd+N`: New player
- `Enter`: Submit form
- `Esc`: Close modal

/>

// Display in card
<img src={player.player_photo_url} alt={player.name} />
```

---

### Phase 2: Player Statistics Integration

**1. Link Players to Game Events**
```sql
-- Add player_id to game_events
ALTER TABLE game_events
  ADD COLUMN player_id UUID REFERENCES players(id);

-- Query player stats
SELECT
  p.first_name,
  p.last_name,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ge.event_type = 'shot') as shots,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ge.event_type = 'shot' AND ge.details->>'result' = 'goal') as goals
FROM players p
LEFT JOIN game_events ge ON ge.player_id = p.id
WHERE p.team_id = 'team-uuid'
GROUP BY p.id;
```

**2. Player Performance Dashboard**
- Games played
- Goals, assists, points
- Plus/minus
- Time on ice (future)
- Position-specific stats (shots for forwards, blocks for defense, saves for goalies)

**3. Season Leaders**
```typescript
// Top scorers widget
<div className="bg-white rounded-lg p-4">
  <h3>Top Scorers</h3>
  {topScorers.map((player, rank) => (
    <div key={player.id}>
      {rank + 1}. {player.name} - {player.goals}G {player.assists}A
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Roster Features

**1. Depth Chart Builder**
```typescript
// Drag-and-drop line assignments
<DndContext>
  <Line number={1}>
    <PlayerSlot position="LW" player={player1} />
    <PlayerSlot position="C" player={player2} />
    <PlayerSlot position="RW" player={player3} />
  </Line>
</DndContext>
```

**2. Player Notes & Tags**
```sql
-- Add notes to players
ALTER TABLE players
  ADD COLUMN notes TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN tags TEXT[];

-- Example tags
tags: ['captain', 'injury-watch', 'call-up']
```

**3. Roster Comparisons**
- Compare current roster to previous season
- Track player development over time
- Identify gaps in position depth

**4. Eligibility Tracking**
```typescript
// Age verification
function isAgeEligible(birthdate: string, ageGroup: number) {
  const cutoffDate = new Date('2025-12-31')
  const age = cutoffDate.getFullYear() - new Date(birthdate).getFullYear()
  return age <= ageGroup
}

// Visual indicator
{!isAgeEligible(player.birthdate, team.age_years) && (
  <span className="text-red-600">⚠️ Age ineligible</span>
)}
```

---

### Phase 4: Mobile App Features

**1. Offline Support**
```typescript
// IndexedDB for roster caching
const db = await openDB('roster-cache', 1)
await db.put('rosters', players, teamId)

// Sync on reconnect
if (navigator.onLine) {
  await syncRosterChanges()
}
```

**2. Player Check-In**
```typescript
// Track attendance at games/practices
<Checkbox
  checked={player.isPresent}
  onChange={() => markAttendance(player.id)}
/>

// Attendance stats
Present: 8/10 games (80%)
```

**3. Quick Stats Entry**
```typescript
// During game, tap player to log event
<PlayerCard onClick={() => logShotForPlayer(player.id)}>
  {player.name} - Quick Tap to Log Shot
</PlayerCard>
```
