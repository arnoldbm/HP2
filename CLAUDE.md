## üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW

**What are we building?**
A hockey practice planning app with live game tracking that generates AI-powered, data-driven practice plans for youth hockey coaches.

**Key Differentiator**: Real-time game event tracking (shots, breakouts, turnovers) ‚Üí Objective analytics ‚Üí AI-generated practice plans targeting specific weaknesses.

**Target Market**: North American youth hockey (ages 8-18, USA & Canada)

**Business Model**: Freemium SaaS
- Free: 3 tracked games/season
- Premium: $14.99/mo (unlimited tracking + analytics)
- Pro: $29.99/mo (season trends + comparative analytics)

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

### Tech Stack
```
Frontend:  Next.js 14+ (App Router, TypeScript strict)
Backend:   Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + RLS + Edge Functions)
Testing:   Vitest (unit/integration) + Playwright (E2E)
State:     Zustand
Forms:     React Hook Form + Zod
UI:        TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
Offline:   IndexedDB (Dexie.js) + Service Workers (PWA)
Canvas:    Konva.js (interactive ice surface)
Charts:    Recharts (heat maps, analytics)
AI:        OpenAI GPT-4 (practice plan generation)
Payments:  Stripe (Checkout + Customer Portal)
```

### Database Design Philosophy
- **Polymorphic events table**: Single `game_events` table with JSONB `details` column (easier queries, simpler to extend)
- **Spatial data**: Ice coordinates (x: 0-200, y: 0-100) for heat maps
- **Audit trail**: `event_edit_history` table for all event edits
- **Pre-computed analytics**: `game_analytics` table (avoid expensive real-time calculations)
- **RLS everywhere**: Row-level security for multi-tenant data isolation

### Age Group Handling (USA vs Canada)
**Critical decision**: Store age as INTEGER, format on display

| USA | Canada | Stored Value |
|-----|--------|--------------|
| 8U  | U9     | 9            |
| 10U | U11    | 11           |
| 12U | U13    | 13           |

- Teams have `region` field ('usa' or 'canada')
- TypeScript utilities: `formatAgeGroup()`, `parseAgeGroup()`
- Database function: `format_age_group(age_years, region)`

**Why integers?** Single source of truth, easy comparisons, regional formatting at display layer.

See: `docs/DEV_SETUP_AND_DATA_MODELS.md` (lines 241-300, 708-790)

---

## üß™ TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

### TDD Philosophy
**Write tests FIRST, then implement features**

1. Write failing test
2. Implement minimal code to pass test
3. Refactor for quality
4. Repeat

### Test Coverage Goals
- Core business logic: **100%**
- Database operations: **100%**
- API routes: **95%+**
- UI components: **80%+**
- E2E critical paths: **100%**

### Example TDD Files (templates ready)
- `tests/unit/age-groups.test.ts` - Age group formatting/parsing
- `tests/unit/shot-quality.test.ts` - Shot quality calculator (high/medium/low danger)
- `tests/integration/game-events.test.ts` - Event CRUD with RLS
- `tests/e2e/game-tracking.spec.ts` - Live tracking flow

See: `docs/DEV_SETUP_AND_DATA_MODELS.md` (lines 843-1170)

## üìä DATABASE SCHEMA QUICK REFERENCE

### Core Entities Hierarchy
```
organizations
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ teams (age_years, region, level)
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ players (jersey_number, position)
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ games (opponent, date, status)
  ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game_events (type, x/y coords, details JSONB)
  ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ game_analytics (pre-computed stats)
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ practices

  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ users (with roles)

drills (global + org-specific)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ addresses_situations JSONB (links drills to game issues)
```

### Key Tables

**game_events** (polymorphic design):
```sql
- event_type: 'shot' | 'breakout' | 'turnover' | 'zone_entry' | ...
- x_coord, y_coord (0-200, 0-100)
- period, game_time_seconds
- player_id
- situation: 'even_strength' | 'power_play' | 'penalty_kill'
- details: JSONB (event-specific data)
```

**Shot event details**:
```json
{
  "shot_type": "wrist",
  "result": "save",
  "shot_quality": "high"
}
```

**Breakout event details**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "type": "up_boards",
  "exit_zone": "left"
}
```

### Ice Surface Coordinates
```
Defensive Zone ‚Üê ‚Üí Offensive Zone
(0,0)           (100,100)         (200,100)
Left corner     Center ice        Right corner

High-danger zone (slot): x: 80-110, y: 35-65
```

## üîë CRITICAL DECISIONS LOG

### Decided ‚úÖ
| Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Polymorphic events table | Simpler queries, easier to extend event types | All events in one table with JSONB details |
| Age stored as integer | Single source of truth, regional formatting at display layer | USA/Canada both supported seamlessly |
| MVP includes BOTH shots + defense tracking | Real coach feedback - defensive tracking is crucial | Larger Phase 2, but complete feature |
| Event editing in MVP | Stat trackers make mistakes during fast-paced games | Edit UI + audit log in MVP |
| Live stats during game | Coaches want to see progress in real-time | Expandable stats panel |
| SVG over Canvas for ice surface | Easier tap interactions, accessibility | Use Konva.js or plain SVG |
| Offline-first with PWA | Rinks often have poor WiFi | IndexedDB + service workers required |
| Single tracker in MVP | Multi-tracker collaboration is complex | Defer merging to post-MVP |

### To Decide ü§î
- [ ] Game situation detection (PP/PK): Manual buttons or auto-detect from penalties?
- [ ] Free tier: 3 games or unlimited tracking with limited analytics?
- [ ] Premium pricing: $14.99 or $19.99/month?
- [ ] Should AI explain WHY it chose drills (show tracked data)?
- [ ] Ice surface: Konva.js or plain SVG + React?
- [ ] Video hosting: YouTube embeds or self-hosted?

---

## üêõ COMMON PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS

### Problem: Age group confusion between USA and Canada
**Solution**: Store as integer (9), format on display based on team's `region` field.
- USA: `formatAgeGroup(9, 'usa')` ‚Üí "8U"
- Canada: `formatAgeGroup(9, 'canada')` ‚Üí "U9"

See: `docs/DEV_SETUP_AND_DATA_MODELS.md` (lines 708-790)

---

### Problem: Game events are diverse (shots, turnovers, breakouts, etc.)
**Solution**: Polymorphic table with JSONB `details` column instead of separate tables.
- Easier queries: `SELECT * FROM game_events WHERE game_id = ?`
- Type-safe with Zod schemas for each event type
- Easy to add new event types without migrations

See: `docs/DEV_SETUP_AND_DATA_MODELS.md` (lines 362-449)

---

### Problem: Real-time analytics are expensive to compute
**Solution**: Pre-compute analytics after game completion, store in `game_analytics` table.
- Triggered by game status change to 'completed'
- Includes: shot charts, breakout success rates, AI insights
- Serve from cache for instant loading

See: `docs/DEV_SETUP_AND_DATA_MODELS.md` (lines 634-675)

---

### Problem: Rinks have poor WiFi, need offline tracking
**Solution**: PWA with IndexedDB + background sync
- All events stored locally first (IndexedDB via Dexie.js)
- `sync_queue` table tracks pending changes
- Background Sync API syncs when online
- Visual indicator: "Offline - will sync when connected"

See: `docs/DEV_SETUP_AND_DATA_MODELS.md` (lines 677-702)

---

## üìù TODO: HIGH-PRIORITY ITEMS

### Immediate Next Steps
- [ ] Initialize Next.js project with setup from `docs/DEV_SETUP_AND_DATA_MODELS.md`
- [ ] Setup Supabase local dev environment
- [ ] Create first migration (organizations, teams, players)
- [ ] Write + implement age group utilities (TDD practice)
- [ ] Setup testing infrastructure (Vitest + Playwright configs)

### Before Phase 2 (Ice Surface)
- [ ] Prototype ice surface tap interactions (SVG coordinate mapping)
- [ ] Design event logging flow (minimize taps, maximize speed)
- [ ] Test offline sync mechanism (simulate poor WiFi)
- [ ] Create ice surface coordinate system diagram

### Before Launch
- [ ] Seed drill library with 100+ drills
- [ ] Create AI prompt templates for practice plan generation
- [ ] Design onboarding flow for new coaches
- [ ] Beta test with 3-5 real teams (full season)
- [ ] Performance testing (can handle 50+ events per game?)
