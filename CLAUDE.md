## üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW

**What are we building?**
A hockey practice planning app with live game tracking that generates AI-powered, data-driven practice plans for youth hockey coaches.

**Key Differentiator**: Real-time game event tracking (shots, breakouts, turnovers) ‚Üí Objective analytics ‚Üí AI-generated practice plans targeting specific weaknesses.

**Target Market**: North American youth hockey (ages 8-18, USA & Canada)

**Business Model**: Freemium SaaS
- Free: 3 tracked games/season
- Premium: $14.99/mo (unlimited tracking + analytics)
- Pro: $29.99/mo (season trends + comparative analytics)

---

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

### Tech Stack
```
Frontend:  Next.js 14+ (App Router, TypeScript strict)
Backend:   Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + RLS + Edge Functions)
Testing:   Vitest (unit/integration) + Playwright (E2E)
State:     Zustand
Forms:     React Hook Form + Zod
UI:        TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
Offline:   IndexedDB (Dexie.js) + Service Workers (PWA)
Canvas:    Konva.js (interactive ice surface)
Charts:    Recharts (heat maps, analytics)
AI:        OpenAI GPT-4 (practice plan generation)
Payments:  Stripe (Checkout + Customer Portal)
```

### Database Design Philosophy
- **Polymorphic events table**: Single `game_events` table with JSONB `details` column (easier queries, simpler to extend)
- **Spatial data**: Ice coordinates (x: 0-200, y: 0-100) for heat maps
- **Audit trail**: `event_edit_history` table for all event edits
- **Pre-computed analytics**: `game_analytics` table (avoid expensive real-time calculations)
- **RLS everywhere**: Row-level security for multi-tenant data isolation

### Age Group Handling (USA vs Canada)
**Critical decision**: Store age as INTEGER, format on display

| USA | Canada | Stored Value |
|-----|--------|--------------|
| 8U  | U9     | 9            |
| 10U | U11    | 11           |
| 12U | U13    | 13           |

- Teams have `region` field ('usa' or 'canada')
- TypeScript utilities: `formatAgeGroup()`, `parseAgeGroup()`
- Database function: `format_age_group(age_years, region)`

**Why integers?** Single source of truth, easy comparisons, regional formatting at display layer.

See: `docs/DEV_SETUP_AND_DATA_MODELS.md` (lines 241-300, 708-790)

---

## üß™ TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

### TDD Philosophy
**Write tests FIRST, then implement features**

1. Write failing test
2. Implement minimal code to pass test
3. Refactor for quality
4. Repeat

### Test Coverage Goals
- Core business logic: **100%**
- Database operations: **100%**
- API routes: **95%+**
- UI components: **80%+**
- E2E critical paths: **100%**

### Example TDD Files (templates ready)
- `tests/unit/age-groups.test.ts` - Age group formatting/parsing
- `tests/unit/shot-quality.test.ts` - Shot quality calculator (high/medium/low danger)
- `tests/integration/game-events.test.ts` - Event CRUD with RLS
- `tests/e2e/game-tracking.spec.ts` - Live tracking flow

See: `docs/DEV_SETUP_AND_DATA_MODELS.md` (lines 843-1170)

## üîë CRITICAL DECISIONS LOG

### Decided ‚úÖ
| Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Polymorphic events table | Simpler queries, easier to extend event types | All events in one table with JSONB details |
| Age stored as integer | Single source of truth, regional formatting at display layer | USA/Canada both supported seamlessly |
| MVP includes BOTH shots + defense tracking | Real coach feedback - defensive tracking is crucial | Larger Phase 2, but complete feature |
| Event editing in MVP | Stat trackers make mistakes during fast-paced games | Edit UI + audit log in MVP |
| Live stats during game | Coaches want to see progress in real-time | Expandable stats panel |
| SVG over Canvas for ice surface | Easier tap interactions, accessibility | Use Konva.js or plain SVG |
| Offline-first with PWA | Rinks often have poor WiFi | IndexedDB + service workers required |
| Single tracker in MVP | Multi-tracker collaboration is complex | Defer merging to post-MVP |
| Goal is a shot with result='goal' | Eliminates redundancy, simplifies queries, cleaner data model | Removed 'goal' event type, pre-fill result in UI |
| Database persistence with optimistic updates | Instant UI feedback, background sync to Supabase | Better UX, handles slow connections |
| Recharts for analytics | Pre-installed, good docs, sufficient for MVP needs | Bar/line/pie charts for all analytics |
| AI explains drill choices | Coaches need to trust AI recommendations | Shows focus areas, links drills to specific game stats |
| Explicit game creation with metadata | Better organization, clearer game history | Create game with opponent name & location before tracking |
| Game selector in analytics | Support multiple games per team | Dropdown to switch between games, auto-loads most recent |
| Replace browser dialogs with inline forms | Better UX, editable inputs, mobile-friendly | React forms instead of prompt()/alert() |
| OpenAI GPT-4o for practice plans | Latest model, best at structured output | JSON mode for reliable parsing |

### To Decide ü§î
- [ ] Game situation detection (PP/PK): Manual buttons or auto-detect from penalties?
- [ ] Free tier: 3 games or unlimited tracking with limited analytics?
- [ ] Premium pricing: $14.99 or $19.99/month?
- [x] ~~Should AI explain WHY it chose drills (show tracked data)?~~ ‚úÖ YES - implemented with reasoning display
- [ ] Ice surface: Konva.js or plain SVG + React?
- [ ] Video hosting: YouTube embeds or self-hosted?

---

## üêõ COMMON PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS

### Problem: Age group confusion between USA and Canada
**Solution**: Store as integer (9), format on display based on team's `region` field.
- USA: `formatAgeGroup(9, 'usa')` ‚Üí "8U"
- Canada: `formatAgeGroup(9, 'canada')` ‚Üí "U9"

See: `docs/DEV_SETUP_AND_DATA_MODELS.md` (lines 708-790)

---

### Problem: Game events are diverse (shots, turnovers, breakouts, etc.)
**Solution**: Polymorphic table with JSONB `details` column instead of separate tables.
- Easier queries: `SELECT * FROM game_events WHERE game_id = ?`
- Type-safe with Zod schemas for each event type
- Easy to add new event types without migrations

See: `docs/DEV_SETUP_AND_DATA_MODELS.md` (lines 362-449)

---

### Problem: Should 'Goal' be a separate event type or a shot with result='goal'?
**Solution**: Treat goal as a shot with result='goal', not a separate event type.
- Eliminates redundancy in data model
- Simplifies queries: `WHERE event_type = 'shot' AND details->>'result' = 'goal'`
- UI preserves UX: Goal button pre-fills result field
- Migration: Converted existing 'goal' events to 'shot' with result='goal'

See: `supabase/migrations/20251027235333_remove_goal_event_type.sql`

---

### Problem: Real-time analytics are expensive to compute
**Solution**: Pre-compute analytics after game completion, store in `game_analytics` table.
- Triggered by game status change to 'completed'
- Includes: shot charts, breakout success rates, AI insights
- Serve from cache for instant loading

See: `docs/DEV_SETUP_AND_DATA_MODELS.md` (lines 634-675)

---

### Problem: Rinks have poor WiFi, need offline tracking
**Solution**: PWA with IndexedDB + background sync
- All events stored locally first (IndexedDB via Dexie.js)
- `sync_queue` table tracks pending changes
- Background Sync API syncs when online
- Visual indicator: "Offline - will sync when connected"

See: `docs/DEV_SETUP_AND_DATA_MODELS.md` (lines 677-702)

---

### Problem: Analytics page showing 0 events, how does it know which game?
**Solution**: Auto-load most recent game and provide game selector dropdown.
- Analytics page fetches all games for user's team on mount
- Auto-selects most recent game by game_date
- Loads events from database for selected game
- Dropdown allows switching between games
- Game display format: "vs {opponent_name} - {date} @ {location}"
- Resolves issue where analytics relied only on Zustand store

See: `app/demo/analytics/page.tsx` (lines 30-80)

---

### Problem: Browser dialogs (prompt/alert) are poor UX for game creation
**Solution**: Replace with inline React forms.
- Show/hide form with useState toggle
- Controlled inputs for opponent name (required) and location (optional)
- Submit button with loading state
- Cancel button to dismiss form
- Auto-focus first input for keyboard accessibility
- Form validation before submission
- Better mobile experience

See: `components/game-tracking/live-stats.tsx` (lines 36-119, 216-274)

### When starting a new session:
1. **Always read this file first** to understand project context
2. Check `docs/HOCKEY_PRACTICE_APP_PLAN.md` for product decisions
3. Check `docs/DEV_SETUP_AND_DATA_MODELS.md` for technical details
4. Review "Critical Decisions Log" to avoid re-litigating choices

### When creating new documentation:
1. **Update this file IMMEDIATELY** with the new doc path
2. Add to appropriate section (Database, Testing, etc.)
3. Update "Last Updated" dates
4. If solving a problem, add to "Common Problems & Solutions"

### When making important decisions:
1. **Add to "Critical Decisions Log"** with rationale
2. Update relevant planning docs
3. Consider impact on testing strategy
4. Document any tradeoffs made

### TDD Workflow:
1. Write test first (red)
2. Implement minimal code (green)
3. Refactor (clean)
4. Update docs if needed
5. Commit with descriptive message

## üéØ QUICK START FOR NEW SESSIONS

**Claude, if you're reading this in a new session:**

1. This is a hockey practice planning app with live game tracking
2. We're using TDD (tests first, always!)
3. Key docs: `docs/HOCKEY_PRACTICE_APP_PLAN.md` + `docs/DEV_SETUP_AND_DATA_MODELS.md`
4. **Current phase: Phase 4-6 (70% complete)** üöß - AI Practice Plan Generation LIVE!
5. Critical decisions:
   - Age groups stored as integers, formatted by region
   - Goal is a shot with result='goal' (not separate event type)
   - Database persistence with optimistic updates
   - AI explains WHY it chose drills (focus areas + game stats)
   - Explicit game creation with metadata (opponent, location)
   - Game selector in analytics for multi-game support
6. MVP scope is locked - see "MVP SCOPE" section above
